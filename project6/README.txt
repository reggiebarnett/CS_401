This program solves the N-Queens problem by searching through
permutations of row numbers and checking for conflicts.  It generates
permutations left-to-right and can includes an option to prune the
search as soon as a conflict is noticed.

  nQueens.java

Compile and run with:

USAGE

Enter the amount of Queens you want. The program checks 
each row and column for a safe position.
